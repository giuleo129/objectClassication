ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements an image classification pipeline using PyTorch and a ResNet-18 backbone. The model is trained on a custom dataset with 8 classes, leveraging extensive data augmentation (random flips, rotations, affine transforms, color jitter, Gaussian blur, noise, random erasing) to improve generalization.

The training loop includes:

Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.

Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling and early stopping.

Train/validation split with monitoring of accuracy and loss.

Model checkpointing to save the best weights.

After training, the pipeline supports:

Evaluation on the test set and CSV export of predictions.

Grad-CAM visualizations to interpret the modelâ€™s decisions and highlight the most important image regions influencing predictions.

This combination of training, validation, testing, and interpretability ensures both performance and explainability of the deep learning model.
